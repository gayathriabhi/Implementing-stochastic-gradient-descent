# Implementing-stochastic-gradient-descent
tried to implement the familiar stochastic gradient descent algorithm in my own 
and compared it with sklearn's SGD package SGDRegressor.

Ran and tested the algorithm for Boston Housing Prices Data.


Boston Housing Prices dataset has a typical regression problem where pricing of the house in boston is needed to be
found based on various independent variables such as crime rate per capita etc
